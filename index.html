        <h1>Welcome.</h1>
        <h3>This is the homepage. Use the menu on the left to explore.</h3>
        <p>Now, if you’re the kind of person who needs an introduction to something this basic, keep reading.</p>

        <h2>This is my website.</h2>
        <p>It exists. You're here. That's about it.</p>
        <p>Built with nothing but raw HTML and a sprinkle of CSS for decency. No JavaScript. No frameworks. And absolutely no soul.</p>

        <h3>Design?</h3>
        <p>Oh, it’s basic. I slapped some text on a page, added just enough CSS to make it not look like a ransom note, and called it a day. Fancy? No. Does it work? Depends on how low your standards are.</p>

        <h3>Why does this site exist?</h3>
        <p>Because I felt like it. And to increment the count of pointless websites on the beautiful World Wide Web.</p>

        <h3>What can you expect here?</h3>
        <p>HTML. A bit of CSS. Words. Maybe even some pictures if I'm feeling fancy. That's about it. Manage your expectations accordingly.</p>

        <p>So yeah, this is my website. Click around, or don't. Either way, it's not going anywhere.</p>
        <h3>The menu on the left is still there. Go ahead, click something.</h3>
